            <p> Joëlle Steendam is currently a Master’s student in Architecture at the TU Delft, 
                who enjoys being creative and has a background in both Architecture and Industrial 
                Design Engineering. She is especially interested in projects of social impact. 
                Her bachelor graduation project, Edubox, created a learning environment 
                for refugee camps in Jordan, and her high school graduation project focused 
                on Senior housing in Surinam, both of which were constructed.
                <br><br>
                During her Bachelor’s in Industrial Design Engineering, 
                Joëlle particularly enjoyed creative courses, often taking the lead on the design 
                and visuals such as sketches, posters, prototypes, and models. To broaden and further enhance 
                her design skills, she completed a shortened Bachelor’s degree in Architecture,
                and is now advancing her expertise in the Architecture Master’s program. To gain practical experience, 
                Joëlle interned at architecture firm De Zwarte Hond and design office Waacs. 
                Here, she worked on several projects, including competition entries in Berlin and Iceland.
